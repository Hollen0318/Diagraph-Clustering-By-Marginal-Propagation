# Digraph Clustering by Marginal Propagation

Community within graphs features both stronger similarities and differences within and between other communities. This paper approaches this problem differently by viewing community detection as a semi-supervised learning task, where the community labels are generated from marginal propagation. We test the approach on one graph dataset with ground-truth community labels. 

By comparing our method with true labels, the results show that though performance may not be optimal compared with agglomerative method, it predicts more abundant features that can be further utilized for overlapping community detection, and membership community similarity.
